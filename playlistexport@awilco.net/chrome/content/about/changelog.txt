0.1.1.8 (April 6, 2008)
==============================
- This update was released to address compatibility issues left unnoticed when the
previous update for this addon was released:
	- The "Export Playlists" menuitem was no longer present on Songbird 0.5

was incorrect

==============================

	the the file type selected in the file type selection field
	of the "Export Playlist To" dialog will be automatically set to
	the file type indicated by file extension of the file name 
	in it's file path entered.
FIXES FOR THE FOLLOWING BUGS:
	- Changes made to nsILocalFile on Songbird 0.5 caused changeExportPath()
	to fail, therefore preventing the "Export Playlist To" dialog from
	displaying at all when clicking on the Change Path "..." button.

	playlist involved.

0.1.1.2 (November 11, 2007)
=============================
- On Linux, Playlist Export Tool tries to use a locale DTD

preventing the Export Playlist(s) menuitem from showing up on
Songbird's File menu.
